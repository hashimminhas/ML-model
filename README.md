and other algorithm like (RF , LR , SVC )
also check is this model complete or fine and ready to deploy to the backend  


# Roman

in this model we repeat the same process but achive same accuracy( 64 to 67  ) with different algorithm like (SVM, XGBoost,RF, )

i can't figure out the problem in this model weather the code is incorrect on the dataset of roman urdu is inbalance after the spliting on test and train sets.



# Question

Review the code is any mistake apply changes or let me tell what to do ?  
is this model ok to deploy with to backend?  
how do we combine both these model to deploy at backend?
